## Minimum (Maximum) Path to Reach a Target

### Problem Statement

Given a target, find the minimum (or maximum) cost/path/sum to reach the target.

### Approach

- **Choose the minimum (or maximum) path** among all possible paths before the current state.
- **Add the value** for the current state to get the cost/path/sum.

**Formula:**

```java
// Formula for choosing minimum cost to reach the target
routes[i] = min(routes[i-1], routes[i-2], ..., routes[i-k]) + cost[i];
Top-Down Approach
Start from the target and recursively compute the minimum cost from the previous states.
For each previous state, calculate the cost/path recursively, and add it to the current state.
Use memoization to store already computed results for efficiency.

Copy code
public int minCost(int target, int[] cost, int[] ways, Map<Integer, Integer> memo) {
    // Base case: if the target is less than 0, return a large number (infinity)
    if (target < 0) return Integer.MAX_VALUE;
    
    // Base case: if the target is 0, return 0 as cost
    if (target == 0) return 0;

    // Check if the result for this state is already computed (memoized)
    if (memo.containsKey(target)) return memo.get(target);

    // Initialize result to a large number (infinity)
    int result = Integer.MAX_VALUE;

    // Loop through all possible ways to reach the target
    for (int way : ways) {
        // Recursively compute the minimum cost for the current way
        result = Math.min(result, minCost(target - way, cost, ways, memo) + cost[target]);
    }

    // Store the result in memo to avoid recomputation
    memo.put(target, result);
    return result;
}
Bottom-Up Approach
Initialize a dp array to store the minimum cost for each state (from 0 to the target).
Start from the base case (target 0) and iterate through all possible targets, computing the cost iteratively.
For each target, check all possible ways to reach it and update the dp array.
java

Copy code
public int minCostBottomUp(int target, int[] cost, int[] ways) {
    // Initialize dp array with large values (infinity) to represent uncomputed states
    int[] dp = new int[target + 1];
    Arrays.fill(dp, Integer.MAX_VALUE);
    dp[0] = 0; // Base case: 0 cost to reach target 0

    // Loop through all possible target values from 1 to the final target
    for (int i = 1; i <= target; i++) {
        // Loop through all possible ways to reach the current target
        for (int way : ways) {
            // If current way is valid (i.e., within bounds), calculate the minimum cost
            if (i >= way && dp[i - way] != Integer.MAX_VALUE) {
                dp[i] = Math.min(dp[i], dp[i - way] + cost[i]);
            }
        }
    }

    // Return the minimum cost to reach the target
    return dp[target];
}
Distinct Ways
Problem Statement
Given a target, find the number of distinct ways to reach the target.

Approach
Sum all possible ways to reach the current state. The goal is to count the total number of distinct ways.
Formula:

Copy code
// Formula for summing distinct ways to reach the target
routes[i] = routes[i-1] + routes[i-2] + ... + routes[i-k];
Top-Down Approach
Start from the target and recursively compute the number of ways to reach it.
For each possible way to reduce the target, sum the results recursively.
Use memoization to store already computed results for efficiency.
java
Always show details

Copy code
public int distinctWays(int target, int[] ways, Map<Integer, Integer> memo) {
    // Base case: if the target is less than 0, return 0 as there are no valid ways
    if (target < 0) return 0;

    // Base case: if the target is 0, return 1 as it's one valid way
    if (target == 0) return 1;

    // Check if the result for this state is already computed (memoized)
    if (memo.containsKey(target)) return memo.get(target);

    // Initialize result to 0
    int result = 0;

    // Loop through all possible ways to reach the target
    for (int way : ways) {
        // Recursively compute the number of ways for the current way
        result += distinctWays(target - way, ways, memo);
    }

    // Store the result in memo to avoid recomputation
    memo.put(target, result);
    return result;
}
Bottom-Up Approach
Initialize a dp array to store the number of distinct ways for each state (from 0 to the target).
Start from the base case (target 0) and iterate through all possible targets, summing the distinct ways iteratively.
For each target, check all possible ways to reach it and update the dp array.
java
Always show details

Copy code
public int distinctWaysBottomUp(int target, int[] ways) {
    // Initialize dp array with 0 values, as there are initially 0 ways to reach any target
    int[] dp = new int[target + 1];
    dp[0] = 1; // Base case: 1 way to reach target 0 (do nothing)

    // Loop through all possible target values from 1 to the final target
    for (int i = 1; i <= target; i++) {
        // Loop through all possible ways to reach the current target
        for (int way : ways) {
            // If current way is valid, sum the ways to reach the current target
            if (i >= way) {
                dp[i] += dp[i - way];
            }
        }
    }

    // Return the total number of distinct ways to reach the target
    return dp[target];
}
Merging Intervals
Problem Statement
Given a set of intervals, find an optimal solution for the problem considering the current interval and the best you can get from the left and right sides.

Approach
Divide and conquer: Find optimal solutions for every interval and combine them.
Formula:

java

Copy code
// Formula for combining results of left and right intervals
dp[i][j] = dp[i][k] + result[k] + dp[k+1][j]
Top-Down Approach
Recursively calculate the best result for every sub-interval and combine the results.
Memoize the intermediate results to avoid redundant calculations.
java
Always show details

Copy code
public int mergeIntervals(int[] nums, int i, int j, Map<String, Integer> memo) {
    // Base case: no intervals to merge, return 0
    if (i >= j) return 0;

    // Check if the result for this subproblem is already computed (memoized)
    String key = i + "," + j;
    if (memo.containsKey(key)) return memo.get(key);

    // Initialize result to 0
    int result = Integer.MAX_VALUE;

    // Recursively find the best result by splitting the intervals at different points
    for (int k = i; k < j; k++) {
        result = Math.min(result, mergeIntervals(nums, i, k, memo) + mergeIntervals(nums, k+1, j, memo));
    }

    // Store the result in memo to avoid recomputation
    memo.put(key, result);
    return result;
}
Bottom-Up Approach
Use dynamic programming to calculate the optimal result for merging intervals from bottom to top.
Compute the best result for each sub-interval and combine them iteratively.
java
Always show details

Copy code
public int mergeIntervalsBottomUp(int[] nums) {
    int n = nums.length;
    int[][] dp = new int[n][n];

    // Fill the DP table by calculating the best result for each sub-interval
    for (int len = 2; len <= n; len++) {
        for (int i = 0; i <= n - len; i++) {
            int j = i + len - 1;
            dp[i][j] = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
            for (int k = i; k < j; k++) {
                dp[i][j] = Math.min(dp[i][j], dp[i][k] + dp[k+1][j]);
            }
        }
    }

    // Return the result for the whole interval
    return dp[0][n-1];
}
DP on Strings
Problem Statement
Given two strings s1 and s2, return some result, such as the longest common subsequence, minimum edit distance, etc.

Approach
The problems on strings often require a solution that can be computed in O(n^2)
